### 🐛 Early Blight - *Alternaria solani*

**Symptoms:**
- Brown spots with concentric rings on older leaves.
- Yellowing and drying leaves starting from the bottom.

**Pesticide Treatment:**
- Apply fungicides like **Chlorothalonil**, **Mancozeb**, or **Azoxystrobin** early in the season.
- Repeat every 7–10 days during humid conditions.

**Organic Treatment:**
- Use **neem oil** or **compost tea spray** weekly.
- Remove infected leaves manually.
- Improve air circulation through proper spacing.

**Prevention Tips:**
- Rotate crops every 2–3 years.
- Avoid overhead watering.
- Ensure good drainage and soil health.

### 🌧️ Late Blight - *Phytophthora infestans*

**Symptoms:**
- Large, dark brown to black lesions on leaves and stems.
- White fungal growth on undersides of leaves in humid weather.
- Rapid plant collapse in severe infections.

**Pesticide Treatment:**
- Use **Metalaxyl**, **Copper-based fungicides**, or **Cyazofamid**.
- Apply before disease spreads, especially in wet weather.

**Organic Treatment:**
- Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
- Apply **baking soda + oil + soap** spray.
- Use resistant varieties if possible.

**Prevention Tips:**
- Avoid waterlogged soils.
- Disinfect tools after contact.
- Keep leaves dry—water in early morning.

### 🌿 Healthy Potato Plant

Your plant shows no signs of disease. Keep up the good work!

**Care Tips:**
- Regularly check leaves for early signs of spots or lesions.
- Fertilize with balanced NPK fertilizers.
- Mulch around the base to retain moisture and control weeds.
- Keep good air flow between plants.

**Preventative Measures:**
- Crop rotation.
- Use certified disease-free seed potatoes.
- Water early in the day to avoid prolonged moisture.
